Operating model for the BoB mixed fishery.

To evaluate the consequences and risks associated with alternative implementations of a policy limiting or eliminating discards at sea in a mixed fishery, we will use Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE). In such modelling framework, advice and management systems can be quantitatively evaluated through simulation testing \citep{Kell2007,Dichmont2013}. This involves creating simulation models that best represent both current knowledge and uncertainty on the dynamics of fish stocks under fishing pressure, the effect on fishers of variations in stock status and availability, and their responses to those changes and those in management regimes. A set of operating models (OMs) will be built using the tools provided by the FLR framework (Fisheries Library in R, \url{http://www.flr-project.org}, \citep{Kell2007}). Individual models of the biology of the various stocks will be coupled with those representing the fleets operating on them.
